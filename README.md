# Design-Patterns-in-Kotlin
Design patterns can speed up our software development process because they provide tested, proven development paradigms.<br/><br/>
Design patterns are solutions to common problems that software developers encounter during software development process. These solutions have been achieved through trial and error by numerous software developers over a long period of time. Later, they gave names to these solutions which they found for certain problems.<br/><br/>
In this repository, I will explain design patterns, object oriented programming and SOLID principles with examples.

## Object Oriented Programming
Object oriented programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm which depends on classes and objects. It helps software developers to structure their codes and make them reusable pieces.<br/><br/>
Software developers are creating many different classes for that.<br/>
Classes are user defined data types which have their own attributes and methods. These methods can determine the logical operations of the class. And attributes can hold data which a class can have.<br/>
We can create as many instances from a class as we want. These instances are called as object.
